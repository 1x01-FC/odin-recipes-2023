<p>These Chewy Ginger Molasses Cookies are easy to make, super-soft and chewy,
    and irresistibly delicious.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, softened to room temperature (not melted*)</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated (white) sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsulphured molasses</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>4 1/2 cups (639 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons baking soda*</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and salt. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Using a separate mixing bowl, either with a stand mixer or a hand mixer, cream together the softened butter and
        sugars on medium-high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy and a pale yellow color, about 2 minutes,
        scraping down the sides occasionally as needed. Mix in the eggs (one at a time) and molasses, and beat on
        medium-low speed
        until each is combined. Gradually add in the dry ingredient mixture and beat until it is evenly incorporated.
    </li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the dough is
        completely chilled.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper; set aside.</li>
    <li>Roll the dough into small balls, about 1-inch in diameter. Fill a separate small bowl with sugar, and roll each
        ball in the sugar until it is completely coated. Place dough balls on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake for about 8-10 minutes, until the cookies begin to slightly crack on top. (They will crack more while
        cooling.) Remove from the oven and let cool for 4-5 minutes. Then transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool
        completely.
    </li>
    <li>Serve warm and enjoy, or store in a sealed container for up to 4 days. Or freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
