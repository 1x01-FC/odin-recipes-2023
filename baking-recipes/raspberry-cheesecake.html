        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line the bottom of your springform pan with a parchment paper round for easy
                removal.
                Then,
                double wrap the pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil.</li>
            <b>Crust</b>
            <li>Use a food processor to make graham cracker crumbs. Alternatively, crush them in a resealable bag using
                a
                rolling pin or
                kitchen mallet. Mix the crumbs with the melted butter, sugar, and salt. It should resemble wet sand and
                hold
                its
                shape
                when pressed. Add the crumbs to the pan and firmly pat down to get an even layer on the bottom and
                sides.
                Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside.
                1 cup graham cracker crumbs,2 ½ tablespoons butter,1 ½ tablespoons sugar,pinch of salt</li>
            <b>Cheesecake Filling</b>
            <li>Make the batter: Reduce the oven to 325°F. Using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or a hand
                mixer,
                beat the
                softened cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla, and salt until smooth and creamy on medium-high
                speed.
                Scrape down the sides and bottom halfway through. Lastly, remove large air bubbles by reducing the speed
                to
                the
                lowest
                setting for 1 to 2 minutes.
                2 8oz packages cream cheese,2 eggs,⅔ cup sugar,⅔ cup sour cream,1 teaspoon vanilla extract,¼ teaspoon
                salt
            </li>
            <li>Water bath: Pour the batter into the springform pan and remove any air bubbles by banging the pan onto
                the
                kitchen
                counter lined with a kitchen towel. Put the springform pan into a larger roasting pan and add hot water
                a
                few
                inches up
                the side to create a water bath.
            <li>Bake: Bake at 325°F for 75 minutes. Turn off the oven and use a wooden spoon to crack open the oven
                door.
                Let
                the
                cheesecake slowly reduce in temperature for one hour then remove it from the oven.</li>
            <li>Chill: Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and remove the foil. Once it reaches room temperature,
                loosely
                cover
                and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours to overnight.</li>
            <b>Raspberry Topping</b>
            <li>To make the sauce, add the fresh or frozen raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice to a pot and heat over
                medium-high heat.
                Use the back of a spoon or masher to break down the raspberries. Once it starts to boil, turn off the
                heat.
                Taste and
                adjust with more sugar or lemon juice as needed.
                2 cups fresh or frozen raspberries,3 to 5 tablespoons sugar,1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>Strain the raspberry sauce to remove the seeds. If needed, thin with 1 teaspoon of water at a time,
                keeping
                in
                mind the
                sauce thickens as it cools. Cover and let it cool.</li>
            <b>Add raspberry topping and serve</b>
            <li>Add the cooled raspberry sauce to the cheesecake and then top with the fresh raspberries for garnish.
                Cut
                slices
                using a
                thin knife that's been dipped in hot water and wiped dry before each slice. Serve with extra raspberry
                sauce
                on
                the side
                and enjoy!
